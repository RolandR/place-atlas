The Turkish flag remained in a crude state until the Netherlands decided to make amends for the earlier destruction of a Greek flag and placed the Greek flag on top of Turkey in a plan called \"Operation Erdogan\". Originally a Dutch-tricolored friendship heart was placed with its center at the top of the border between the Turkish and Greek flags, but was wiped out in later edits.",

There was a brief scuffle that occurred between the Oneshot faction and a sect of the Overwatch faction. At one point, some Overwatch faction members attempted to create the phrase \"HANZO SWITCH PLS\", basing it around the \"SWITCH\" from the neighboring Nintendo Switch sprite. This occured roughly at the same time that the Oneshot faction began to create Niko, and eventually the \"PLS\" and the Niko sprite began to overlap. The Oneshot faction attempted to move the S below the Niko sprite, and a bit of dialogue between various members of both factions proved fruitful at first, until some more agressive members began to put the S over Niko anyway. This started a war of attrition between the two factions, resulting in a compromise of the S being highlighted over the highlighted Niko sprite. Sadly, the pun was not to last, as the Swedish flag would soon invade and conquer much of the north eastern corner, taking the Hanzo and Pls along with it, yet allowing Niko to remain.",

People quickly fixed the artwork, but in the middle of fixing the artwork, Mario got changed into Luigi. Then people tried to change him into Waluigi, and it got so vandalized, that r/ainbowroad held a event to rebuild Mario. But people kept changing him back to Waluigi and Luigi, and it got vandalized again. r/ainbowroad put a notice on their discord that fixing Mario and the road was the main priority. Mario got changed into Wario, and that's when r/place ended. And while all this was happening, everyone tried giving Mario a long nose. This piece inspired the Yoshi piece by it.",

However, after hours of deliberation, the infamous \"five pixel treaty\" was formed, ending the conflict and allowing construction to begin. But the war was not over, in the final minutes treachery struck, a splinter cell of r/uwaterloo violated the treaty and attempted to overtake VT. While the defense fought valiantly, two pixels remain as an eternal reminder of Waterloo's betrayal. ",

Also included is Flowey the Flower, as he sits upon Papyrus' head. r/undertale has a couple of other spots reserved for their characters spread across the canvas.",

Coming in the wake of earlier failed attempts to create signage and /u/7y14r's creation of /r/armok, the original design was by /u/7yl4r https://redd.it/62ujp3/, and much of the original placing was done by /u/MGStan as seen <a class=\"inline\" href=\"https://reddit.com/comments/62tz5v//dfpt40i/\">here</a>. Realizing that he was outnumbered by people unaware of the plan, organization for it was moved into the Dwarf Fortress discord server, and those working against it (or attempting to work for it but not in concert with the plan) were recruited to the discord via reddit PMs. As /r/place activity on the DF discord grew rapidly, a new text channel was created for it.  Soon after it was completed according to the original plan despite the counter-efforts of a redditor very upset about the destruction of a dwarf they had been working on. Later, the 3 tile wide slash was compacted to 2 tiles during an effort to reorganize and compact the lower row of dwarves to gain more room for art. ",

It's one of the oldest patterns to have survived until the freezing of the canvas, and was generally willing to welcome other art into the pattern, as seen in the Buizel art and the FLUFFHEAD text. At one point, an offer was made to permit /r/MMA to create a small sign in the corner of their pattern, though that was rendered unnecessary by the Dwarf Fortress-/r/MMA alliance. Perhaps the most notable of the patterns included in BOPP is the Diamond, originally built by /u/Uncentury and absorbed intact as the pattern grew. BOPP allied with Dwarf Fortress early on, and after several attempts came to an agreement permitting Dwarf Fortress to create a second row of dwarves.<br>",

Further expansion of this area was done by extending the flag downwards and claiming the territory to the left to match, parts of which were already held by other factions. Some, such as a Spanish Flag, were overwritten, and some were incorporated into the design, such as a Duck from r/duckgame and a pixelart Yoshi.<br>Tension between r/ukplace and r/mexico grew when a cactus was built which began extending up into the dress of r/ukplace's depiction of Queen Elizabeth II, but negotiations brought about a peaceful resolution and a non-aggression pact between the two powers.<br>In the final hours of Place, a Void Core was created in the left hand side of this territory and quickly expanded to cover the flag and destroy the pixelart, but was beaten back by a combined effort of r/mexico and several surrounding factions.<br>The flag was quickly rebuilt, but the empty space to the left became contested territory as r/ukplace began construction of Big Ben in the area, to which r/Mexico responded by attempting to expand their flag over it - a project which was only partially completed as Place came to an end.",

It experienced something of a revival in popularity in 2014 with the 'Rare Pepe' meme, which spread far beyond 4chan itself. Most recently, it has become a symbol associated with the controversial alt-right political movement, in particular related to the election campaign of 45th US President Donald Trump, leading to it being considered a hate symbol by some groups. There were several attempts to draw Pepe on Place, but these were largely destroyed on account of its controversial political associations, and only this small one survived.",

The flag took over the white void and a few projects including a smiley and a tree. Then the void reappeared in place and with other people erased most of the flag as RainbowRoad expanded where the flag was. Ireland saw an opportunity  and decided to expand as well.

Though the two flags had previously shown their non-aggression via a heart between them, both worked on their own projects separately.<br>With void troops amassing in the south, neither wanted to abandon the other. Information suggested the void would not target the UK directly due to its strength, instead destroying the area below and moving west into Italy.<br>An agreement between the two countries was reached. The UK would expand its considerable botnet to cover the entirety of the Italian flag. In return, Italy would help to build Big Ben in the space the void left after destroying Mexico.<br>The void attacked once more. Many smaller projects were destroyed to the south, outside of the UK's area of protection. However, UK and Italy stood strong, barely able to harm either country. After the attack, the bond between the two nations stood. As a further act of their friendship, the two planned to cover the hole of the void with a depiction of Dante and Shakespeare to the south.",

To the left is the album cover for The Velvet Underground's 'The Velvet Underground & Nico', featuring art from Andy Warhol, and sometimes considered the first ever indie album. /r/indieheads intended to use this canvas (which was frequently vandalised) to feature a rotating number of albums that would change daily, with the designs for Bjork's Homogenic already having been drawn up.

Every now and then some random griefers would come by, but we managed to fight them off every time. We got a little too close to Scott Pilgrim so with team Scott's help we moved our text slightly to the left. Then came Spelunky, they wanted to build a border around their pixel art and asked us to move one pixel up, so we did, again with their cooperation. Then came Lehigh university from the left. This guy just wanted the text \"Lehigh\" there to represent his university, again we came to a compromise together. <br>But then, after 3 days of cooperation with strangers and battling griefers, about 20 minutes before /r/place was going to end, came the Lehigh university marching band, \"Lehigh 97\". They did not want the text to simply represent their university, it had to represent their marching band. So they trampled their \"97\" over our \"ca\". We were outnumbered. Even the original creator of \"Lehigh\" tried to help stopping them destroying our very small project. We were proud of being able to keep our pixels alive in the giant internet WW3 for 3 days long. After actually meeting some decent people on the internet we were reminded of the usual internet trolls, the jerks of Lehigh University's marching band. All there is left now is half a purple M and the U.",

The first location was at the current location of Northwestern University. Here, OSU and the U of Michigan had colliding corners, prompting a second \"War of Toledo\" as they fought over a small 10 pixel space. After this, the logo was ultimately vandalized and covered over. After other attempts of making the logo, the final incarnation of the \"O\" stood strong by the end of r/Place. A second block \"O\" is situated next to the flag of Ohio elsewhere on r/place. <br> ",

Some of the Dutch planned to overtake the triangular area in this corner, with the Unregistered HyperCam 2, Rainbow Road and the right edge as borders. However, after some discussion of the Dutch diplomats with the makers of Pharah this plan was cancelled and an agreement was made not to expand in their direction. The first made steps of this plan, the orange colour and the border flag, still remains.",

It is as integral a part to the history of the university as the buildings on campus are. On April 3rd, three of the members of The Finest Band East of All Points West were particularly bored with their Systems Software class, and decided to embolden a glorious '97' next to their school's name. Calling for aid from their fellow 94 band members, we set out on a mission to grace the r/place canvas with a beautiful, brown and white '97'. Scores of musicians joined the plight of the bored CS students, and within an hour, the Marching 97 made their mark in Reddit history. To those that tried to oppose them, the Marching 97 pushed them off the face of r/place, just as they marched the puny Lafayette pep band off of their home field, all for the glory and eternal preservation of psyche.",

    	"description": "The Sovereign Triangle, also known as \"the Pink Province\", was a heavily disputed area in the south of the canvas.  It was one of the many early color nations like blue, purple, red, and green.  Unlike the other color nations, pink attracted \"The Followers of Pink\", a loose philosophy built not on war or overwriting, but on simply spreading the warm embrace of pink throughout the canvas.  In this way The Followers of Pink were similar to The Void or Erase This Place, but without an interest in overwriting. Their interest was in peace and simply filling the monochrome (the blank canvas) with the warm peaceful embrace of pink.  \nA few gathered under r/PinkUnion, but were never highly organized.  The region saw fierce battles early on.  First in the south eastern corner where The Blue Corners impending wave hammered away at The Pink Province.  Next at the south western corner where a rainbow (possibly associated with r/ainbowroad) ultimately succeeded in passing through.  The Followers of Pink and r/PinkUnion fought valiantly to preserve the Pink Province and Sovereign Triangle, but the final blow came when the osu! began construction of their second larger logo. Construction began without consent, and ultimately the moderators of r/PinkUnion agreed to a treaty.  Several of The Followers of Pink saw this as an affront to an established pink space, the Sovereign Triangle, which in a rapidly filling canvas became symbolic.  So while osu! constructed their much larger logo with a near mechanical efficiency, The Followers of Pink and supporters fought back by filling the letters and areas that were once The Sovereign Triangle with pink pixels (and other colors).  Due to the pink background of the osu! logo, numerous onslaughts, the disparate nature of The Followers of Pink, and the small size of r/PinkUnion, The Sovereign Triangle was ultimately lost to history.  Though, the battles for, and evidence of, The Sovereign Triangle and Pink Province remain ever evident in the data. ",
