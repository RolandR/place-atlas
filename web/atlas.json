Switzerland quickly formed strong alliances with their neighbors, Hong Kong, Star Wars, the Buffalo Bills, Madeon and Porter Robinson, Fire Emblem, and the Asexual/Aromantic community. nOn Day 2, the Swiss forces pushed to recreate the Matterhorn and donated a portion of their territory to Liechtenstein. The chocolate bar and edelweiss were also built this day. Additionally, a small force ventured to the right side of the map to form Pingu and the SBB logo. Unfortunately, these were lost shortly after. Amongii began to show up on the chocolate bar on this day, but the community opted to keep them because they were cute and appeared to offer protection from additional griefing.nOn the third day, the Swiss expanded further onto the map to form Pingu again. Again, this precious boy was removed from the canvas. On the home front, a train tunnel, a train, a cow, and more flowers were added. The alliance with Hong Kong and Star Wars was immortalized in a joint project on the bottom left of the map. With the help of the French community, a second Swiss flag was built in the bottom left hand corner of the map.

When the canvas expansion occurred the Polish flag overtook the small Mexican one, including the axolotl. When the time-zones caused the Polish to sleep and the Mexicans to wake, the Polish flag was quickly overtook by the Mexican one, to which the artwork depicted now and a couple of tacos with a cute avocado were added. When night came for Mexicans and the sun rose for the Polish, who started their attack by destroying the pixel art, and then began to transform the Mexican flag into a Polish one. After a close battle, a treaty was reached in which the flag was divided in two. Unfortunately the deal was not respected and the streamer replaced the flag with his face, and began expanding the flag to the left, threatening Italy. Consequently, Mexico and Italy came together to overtake the Polish flag, with Mexico overtaking to the left, and Italy to the top, resulting in what is seen now.

Central Alliance continues to thrive on in its Discord and Subreddit, serving as a memento for its place in internet history, as well as a future landing point if [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) ever returns.", "website": "", "subreddit": "[/r/place_CentralAlliance](/r/place_CentralAlliance", "center": [447.5, 994.5], "path": [[448.5, 890.5], [512.5, 890.5], [512.5, 900.5], [548.5, 900.5], [552.5, 900.5], [553.5, 899.5], [554.5, 899.5], [555.5, 898.5], [556.5, 899.5], [557.5, 899.5], [562.5, 899.5], [562.5, 900.5], [562.5, 866.5], [629.5, 866.5], [629.5, 888.5], [655.5, 888.5], [655.5, 909.5], [622.5, 909.5], [622.5, 943.5], [624.5, 943.5], [624.5, 974.5], [624.5, 1012.5], [598.5, 1012.5], [598.5, 1061.5], [624.5, 1061.5], [624.5, 1072.5], [623.5, 1073.5], [622.5, 1075.5], [621.5, 1076.5], [621.5, 1079.5], [622.5, 1080.5], [623.5, 1082.5], [623.5, 1083.5], [624.5, 1083.5], [624.5, 1105.5], [570.5, 1105.5], [570.5, 1111.5], [564.5, 1111.5], [564.5, 1123.5], [552.5, 1123.5], [552.5, 1126.5], [550.5, 1126.5], [550.5, 1130.5], [509.5, 1131.5], [509.5, 1130.5], [498.5, 1130.5], [498.5, 1133.5], [493.5, 1133.5], [493.5, 1128.5], [445.5, 1128.5], [445.5, 1122.5], [322.5, 1122.5], [322.5, 1068.5], [363.5, 1068.5], [363.5, 1039.5], [368.5, 1039.5], [368.5, 1007.5], [336.5, 1007.5], [336.5, 1009.5], [324.5, 1009.5], [323.5, 1009.5], [323.5, 1042.5], [285.5, 1042.5], [285.5, 984.5], [268.5, 984.5], [268.5, 986.5], [263.5, 986.5], [263.5, 984.5], [260.5, 984.5], [260.5, 987.5], [255.5, 987.5], [255.5, 984.5], [253.5, 984.5], [253.5, 986.5], [248.5, 986.5], [248.5, 982.5], [247.5, 981.5], [246.5, 980.5], [245.5, 979.5], [245.5, 964.5], [195.5, 964.5], [195.5, 926.5], [216.5, 926.5], [216.5, 888.5], [355.5, 888.5], [356.5, 889.5], [357.5, 890.5], [358.5, 891.5], [359.5, 892.5], [359.5, 910.5], [361.5, 910.5], [361.5, 907.5], [366.5, 907.5], [366.5, 910.5], [372.5, 910.5], [372.5, 907.5], [377.5, 907.5], [377.5, 910.5], [383.5, 910.5], [383.5, 907.5], [388.5, 907.5], [388.5, 910.5], [394.5, 910.5], [394.5, 907.5], [399.5, 907.5], [399.5, 910.5], [432.5, 910.5], [432.5, 973.5], [432.5, 1118.5], [448.5, 1118.5], [449.5, 984.5], [432.5, 984.5], [432.5, 973.5], [449.5, 973.5], [448.5, 890.5]]},

Despite the absence of these players, a close match was expected, given both teams were traditional FIFA World Cup forces, sharing eight tournaments won and having previously met in the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final, where Brazil won 2\u20130 and earned their fifth title. This match, however, ended in a shocking loss for Brazil; Germany led 5\u20130 at half time, with four goals scored within six minutes, and subsequently brought the score up to 7\u20130 in the second half. Brazil scored a consolation goal in the last minute, ending the match 7\u20131. Germany's Toni Kroos was selected as the man of the match.\n\nThe game marked several tournament records. Germany's win marked the largest margin of victory in a FIFA World Cup semi-final. The game saw Germany overtake Brazil as the highest scoring team in World Cup tournament history and become the first team to reach eight World Cup Finals. Miroslav Klose scored his 16th career World Cup goal and surpassed Brazil's own Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. Brazil's loss broke their 62-match unbeaten streak at home in competitive matches, going back to the 1975 Copa Am\u00e9rica (where they lost 3\u20131 to Peru in same stadium), and equalled their biggest margin of defeat in a match alongside a 6\u20130 loss to Uruguay in 1920. Ultimately, the match was described as a national humiliation.\n\nThe game has subsequently been dubbed the Mineirazo (Mineira\u00e7o [minej\u02c8\u027easu], Agony of Mineir\u00e3o), evoking a previous \"spirit of national shame\" known as the Maracanazo (Maracana\u00e7o) in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay. Brazil subsequently lost 3\u20130 to the Netherlands in the third place play-off.

A very peculiar and chaotic (see website link for VOD timestamp) peace talk was held, and the new alliance took action against a large anime girl in construction. The anime girl was proven to be an overambitious project, and quickly overrun by many communities in the area, including the MC/WC alliance. The new ground gained from the war provided lots of new space for both communities. They were both able to complete the art they wanted, MCSR made art of a Fastion, and WCUE finished construction of all the clan symbols.\n\nMizkif raided the area the next day, cutting through the ground that was gained before. The Fastion was lost, and the Star and Thunder Clans were lost, along with the tree and half of Riverclan. The WCUE gained back ground after Mizkif's art was voided, restoring Thunderclan and Riverclan. MCSR was able to go North and create an End Crystal and a big cactus.\n\nThey avoided disaster from Mizkif and a potentially bloody war between the two communities. They amassed multiple military victories. The alliance was not as prosperous as it was at their peak, but it was still alive and in good shape just in time for the whiteout.", "website": "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1445449517?t=03h39m07s", "subreddit": "", "center": [1465.5, 1460.5], "path": [[1409.5, 1498.5], [1499.5, 1498.5], [1499.5, 1436.5], [1498.5, 1436.5], [1498.5, 1401.5], [1469.5, 1400.5], [1469.5, 1436.5], [1436.5, 1436.5], [1436.5, 1472.5], [1409.5, 1472.5]]},
